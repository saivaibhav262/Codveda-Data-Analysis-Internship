Level 1: Data Analysis Fundamentals

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Visualization to identify trends and patterns


Level 2: Advanced Data Analysis

Task 1: Linear Regression

* Built a regression model to predict **petal length from sepal length**
* Evaluated model using **MSE** and **R² score**
* Visualized regression line and actual values

Outcome:
Linear regression successfully captured the relationship between features.



Task 2: Time Series Analysis

* Analyzed **stock closing prices over time**
* Converted date to time index
* Applied:

  * Trend analysis
  * Seasonal decomposition
  * Moving average smoothing

Outcome:
Identified trends and seasonality patterns in stock price data.


Task 3: K-Means Clustering

* Applied "K-Means clustering" on Iris dataset
* Used "Elbow Method" to find optimal number of clusters
* Visualized clusters to understand natural groupings

Outcome:
Successfully grouped similar data points into meaningful clusters.



-->Key Learnings

*Cleaning and preprocessing real-world datasets.
*Performing EDA and generating actionable visualizations.
*Building and evaluating regression models.
*Applying unsupervised learning (clustering).
*Understanding time series trends and seasonality.
